# Java Programming Test – First Screening  
### Project Name: Surya Srinivas Alladi

This repository contains solutions to the 4 basic coding problems provided as part of the First Screening Test for the interview process.



Programming Language Used: **Java**
   4 separate files created:
  - `Problem-1.java`
  - `Problem-2.java`
  - `Problem-3.java`
  - `Problem-4.java`

Problem Descriptions & Solutions

->Problem-1: Simple Calculator
- Takes two decimal numbers and an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) as input.
- Performs the calculation using modern `switch-case` syntax.
- Returns the correct result or an error message for invalid operators.




->Problem-2: First N Odd Numbers
- Accepts an integer `n` and prints the first `n` odd numbers starting from 1.



-> Problem-3: Conditional Odd Series
- Accepts an integer `a`.
  - If `a` is odd → prints first `a` odd numbers.
  - If `a` is even → prints first `a - 1` odd numbers.
- Implements logic using simple loops and conditionals.


->Problem-4: Count of Numbers Dividing 1–9
- Given an array of integers, for every number from 1 to 9:
  - Counts how many elements in the array divide that number without remainder.
  - Stores and prints the result using a `HashMap`.
  - Includes all numbers from 1 to 9, even if count is 0.


Requirements:
- Java JDK 11 or later
